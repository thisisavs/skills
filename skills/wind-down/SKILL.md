# Wind Down - Session End Checklist

Before ending a session, review and capture important context for future reference.

## Instructions

1. **Find relevant documentation:**
   - Check for `CLAUDE.md` in current working directory
   - Check for `README.md` or other project docs that were referenced
   - Check any directories that were heavily worked on

2. **Review the session:**
   - What was accomplished?
   - What decisions were made and why?
   - Any new workflows, commands, or patterns established?
   - Any user preferences or conventions mentioned?

3. **Update documentation if needed:**
   - Add missing information to relevant docs
   - Keep updates concise but with full context
   - Update existing sections rather than duplicating

4. **Confirm with user:**
   - Summarize what was captured (or note if nothing needed)
   - Ask if anything else needs documenting
   - Say goodbye
